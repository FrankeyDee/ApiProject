# Date Night 1.0

Description - We are building a website that will allow the user to set last minute plans for a date including restaurants and events in a specific area. 
 
Motivation - tired of wondering what you and your date should eat? Or looking for something to do? Your problems are solved. With “Date Night” all we need to know is your zip code and we will provide the best places to eat and all the events going on in your area.
 
Team Efforts - We determine who was comfortable with each portion of the project and delegated the work accordingly.
 
Responsibilities - Will provided his expertise with the HTML layout.  Frankey then blessed the layout with awesome CSS. Zac researched and connected the Open Table Api. Frankey did the same for our Ticketmaster API. As a team we worked together to implement a for loop to show results from both API calls to our HTML page. 
 
Improvements - 
Allow the user to choose a specific date
Allow the user filter food or event selection to a specific category
Provide a map showing the location of the event and restaurant and the distance between the two.
Pull directly from OpenTable Api instead of 3rd party library 
 
Challenges:
Opentable uses oAuth so we had to pull from an Opentable library created by a 3rd party that only shows 26 thousand restaurants.
